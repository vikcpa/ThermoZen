        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <h2>Date Effective: September, 2025</h2>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <p>
        The following Privacy Policy governs the online information collection
        practices of ZenHealth ("we" or "us"). Specifically, it outlines the
        types of information that we gather about you while you are using the
        ZenHealth website (the "Site"), and the ways in which we use this
        information. This Privacy Policy, including our children's privacy
        statement, does not apply to any information you may provide to us or
        that we may collect offline and/or through other means (for example, at
        a live event, via telephone, or through the mail).
      </p>

      <p>
        Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By visiting and using the
        Site, you agree that your use of our Site, and any dispute over privacy,
        is governed by this Privacy Policy. Because the Web is an evolving
        medium, we may need to change our Privacy Policy at some point in the
        future, in which case we'll post the changes to this Privacy Policy on
        this website and update the Effective Date of the policy to reflect the
        date of the changes. By continuing to use the Site after we post any
        such changes, you accept the Privacy Policy as modified.
      </p>

      <h2>How We Collect and Use Information</h2>

      <p>
        We may collect and store personal or other information that you
        voluntarily supply to us online while using the Site (e.g., while on the
        Site or in responding via email to a feature provided on the Site). The
        Site only contacts individuals who specifically request that we do so or
        in the event that they have signed up to receive our messaging, attended
        one of our events, or have purchased one of our products. The Site
        collects personally identifying information from our users during online
        registration and online purchasing. Generally, this information includes
        name and e-mail address for registration or opt-in purposes and name,
        postal address, and credit card information when registering for our
        events or purchasing our products. All of this information is provided
        to us by you.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also collect and store information that is generated automatically as
        you navigate online through the Site. For example, we may collect
        information about your computer's connection to the Internet, which
        allows us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our web pages
        to you and to measure traffic on the Site. We also may use a standard
        feature found in browser software called a "cookie" to enhance your
        experience with the Site. Cookies are small files that your web browser
        places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing how
        and when visitors use the Site, cookies help us deliver advertisements,
        identify how many unique users visit us, and track user trends and
        patterns. They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences
        on certain areas of the Site where you may have entered preference
        information before. The Site also may use web beacons (single-pixel
        graphic files also known as "transparent GIFs") to access cookies and to
        count users who visit the Site or open HTML-formatted email messages.
      </p>

      <p>
        We use the information we collect from you while you are using the Site
        in a variety of ways, including using the information to customize
        features; advertising that appear on the Site; and, making other offers
        available to you via email, direct mail or otherwise. We also may
        provide your information to third parties, such as service providers,
        contractors and third-party publishers and advertisers for a variety of
        purposes. Unless you inform us in accordance with the process described
        below, we reserve the right to use, and to disclose to third parties,
        all of the information collected from and about you while you are using
        the Site in any way and for any purpose, such as to enable us or a third
        party to provide you with information about products and services. If
        you do not wish your information to be used for these purposes, you must
        send a letter to the Online Privacy Coordinator whose address is listed
        at the end of this Privacy Policy requesting to be taken off any lists
        of information that may be used for these purposes or that may be given
        or sold to third-parties.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily make your personal
        information available for viewing by third parties online - for example
        on message boards, web logs, through email, or in chat areas - that
        information can be seen, collected and used by others besides us. We
        cannot be responsible for any unauthorized third-party use of such
        information.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of our third-party advertisers and ad servers that place and
        present advertising on the Site also may collect information from you
        via cookies, web beacons or similar technologies. These third-party
        advertisers and ad servers may use the information they collect to help
        present their advertisements, to help measure and research the
        advertisements' effectiveness, or for other purposes. The use and
        collection of your information by these third-party advertisers and ad
        servers is governed by the relevant third-party's privacy policy and is
        not covered by our Privacy Policy. Indeed, the privacy policies of these
        third-party advertisers and ad servers may be different from ours. If
        you have any concerns about a third party's use of cookies or web
        beacons or use of your information, you should visit that party's
        website and review its privacy policy.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Site also includes links to other websites and provides access to
        products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies
        we do not control. When you access another website or purchase
        third-party products or services through the Site, use of any
        information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the
        operator of the site you are visiting or the provider of such products
        or services.
      </p>

      <p>
        We may also make some content, products and services available through
        our Site or by emailing messages to you through cooperative
        relationships with third-party providers, where the brands of our
        provider partner appear on the Site in connection with such content,
        products, and/or services. We may share with our provider partner any
        information you provide, or that is collected, in the course of visiting
        any pages that are made available in cooperation with our provider
        partner. In some cases, the provider partner may collect information
        from you directly, in which cases the privacy policy of our provider
        partner may apply to the provider partner's use of your information. The
        privacy policy of our provider partners may differ from ours. If you
        have any questions regarding the privacy policy of one of our provider
        partners, you should contact the provider partner directly for more
        information.
      </p>

      <p>
        Be aware that we may occasionally release information about our visitors
        when release is appropriate to comply with law or to protect the rights,
        property, or safety of users of the Site or the public.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please also note that as our business grows, we may buy or sell various
        assets. In the unlikely event that we sell some or all of our assets, or
        one or more of our websites is acquired by another company, information
        about our users may be among the transferred assets.
      </p>

      <h2>Google Analytics</h2>

      <p>
        We also use Google Analytics Advertiser Features to optimize our
        business. Advertiser features include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Remarketing with Google Analytics</li>
        <li>Google Display Network Impression Reporting</li>
        <li>DoubleClick Platform integrations</li>
        <li>Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        By enabling these Google Analytics Display features, we are required to
        notify our visitors by disclosing the use of these features and that we
        and third-party vendors use first-party cookies (such as the Google
        Analytics cookie) or other first-party identifiers, and third-party
        cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party
        identifiers together to gather data about your activities on our Site.
        Among other uses, this allows us to contact you if you begin to fill out
        our check-out form but abandon it before completion with an email
        reminding you to complete your order. The “Remarketing” feature allows
        us to reach people who previously visited our Site, and match the right
        audience with the right advertising message.
      </p>

   

      <h2>Facebook</h2>

      <p>
        As advertisers on Facebook and through our Facebook page, we, (not

          Any ad data collected, received or derived from our Facebook ad
          (“Facebook advertising data”) is only shared with someone acting on
          our behalf, such as our service provider. We are responsible for
          ensuring that our service providers protect any Facebook advertising
          data or any other information obtained from us, limit our use of all
          of that information, and keep it confidential and secure.
        </li>
        <li>
          We do not use Facebook advertising data for any purpose (including
          retargeting, commingling data across multiple advertisers’ campaigns,
          or allowing piggybacking or redirecting with tags), except on an
          aggregate and anonymous basis (unless authorized by Facebook) and only
          to assess the performance and effectiveness of our Facebook
          advertising campaigns.
        </li>
        <li>
          We do not use Facebook advertising data, including the targeting
          criteria for a Facebook ad, to build, append to, edit, influence, or
          augment user profiles, including profiles associated with any mobile
          device identifier or other unique identifier that identifies any
          particular user, browser, computer, or device.
        </li>
        <li>
          We do not transfer any Facebook advertising data (including anonymous,
          aggregate, or derived data) to any ad network, ad exchange, data
          broker, or other advertising or monetization related service.
