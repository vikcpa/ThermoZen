              <p>
                Due to high order volume a customer's order goes directly into
                our fulfillment center to be processed. If the customer contacts
                within 24 hours after they purchased they can cancel their
                order. If the customer contacts after 24 hours of purchase time
                then they will not be able to cancel their order. If your order
                is already processed or has already shipped, we cannot cancel
                the order. Customers will need to either refuse the package and
                immediately notify
                <a href="mail:support@thezenhealth.com"><span><span class="__cf_email__">support@thezenhealth.com</span></span></a>
                the date it was refused or return the package with a valid
                tracking number and notify us with said tracking number so we
                can verify. Once we receive the package back to our warehouse

                has entered. If your order is already processed or has already

              <p>
                In order to obtain your full refund for your bottle(s) you must
                return all bottles be they empty, full or partially full (and
                including any “bonus” or “free” bottles as paper of your order)
                back to our fulfillment center at the address listed below,
                within sixty (180) days of the date you originally ordered the
                product along with a written or printed note- inside the
                package- with the following information clearly written:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Your Order ID (Found in your receipt)</li>

              <p>
                In order for your full refund to be processed the product must
                arrive at our fulfillment facility within sixty (180) days of
                the original purchase date. Failure to include all bottles
                purchased be they empty, full or partially full (including any
                “bonus”, “free” or “gifted” bottles), or failure to clearly
                write your order details as specified above so that a member of
                our fulfillment center staff can clearly read and allocate your
                return will both result in our inability to refund you. You pay
                for the return shipping. Once our fulfillment center has
                received the package and relayed the correct information to us,
                you will be issued a refund. Your refund will be credited back
                to your bank account and may take up to 3-5 business days to
                show in your statement, depending on the speed of the processing
                bank.
              </p>
              <p>
                All returns need to be shipped via USPS to the following

              <p>
